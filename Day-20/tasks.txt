Day 20: LocalStorage and SessionStorage
Tasks/Activities:


Activity 1: Understanding LocalStorage
• Task 1: Write a script to save a string value to localStorage and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
• Task 2: Write a script to save an object to localStorage by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.


Activity 2: Using LocalStorage
• Task 3: Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to localStorage when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
• Task 4: Write a script to remove an item from localStorage . Log the localStorage content before and after removal.


Activity 3: Understanding SessionStorage
• Task 5: Write a script to save a string value to sessionStorage and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
• Task 6: Write a script to save an object to sessionStorage by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.


Activity 4: Using SessionStorage
• Task 7: Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to sessionstorage when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
• Task 8: Write a script to remove an item from sessionstorage . Log the sessionStorage content before and after removal.


Activity 5: Comparing LocalStorage and SessionStorage
• Task 9: Write a function that accepts a key and a value, and saves the value to both localStorage and sessionstorage . Retrieve and log the values from both storage mechanisms.
• Task IO: Write a function that clears all data from both localStorage and sessionstorage . Verify that both storages are empty.


Learnings: 

`localStorage` keeps data even after closing and reopening the browser. `sessionStorage` only keeps data for the current tab or window and clears it when the tab is closed.

`localStorage` data is accessible in all tabs and windows from the same origin. `sessionStorage` data is limited to the same tab or window.

`localStorage` data doesn’t expire and needs to be manually removed. `sessionStorage` data is cleared automatically when the tab or window is closed.
